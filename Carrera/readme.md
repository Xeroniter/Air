### 📄 Final
Our 4 Years in Store is Good, but, Several Challenges Occur for 2019
* Gaining Customer
* Maintain High Customer Satisfaction
* Maintain Stock Availability
* Increasing Total Sales in Low Total Sales City / State  

Store Owner / Management Must Tackle This Challenges in Order to Remain Sustain

While Consumer Segment is Responsible for 50 % Total Sales, Increasing Total Sales in Home Office + Corporate is Achievable by Making Contract to be Their Supplier (Maintain Long Term Income)

On Customer, Perform Several Customer Segmentation Method to Understand Customer Behaviour Even More to Personalized The Interaction, if this Store Have Apps, Performing Market Basket Analysis is Also Good to Recommend Other Product

Our Time Series Model is Perform Best With Seasonal Arima, Why ? There Are Seasonality in Daily Plot Data, While The Model itself Need More Effort to Improve, Our Model is Already at MVP Level.
